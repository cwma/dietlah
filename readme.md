## About DietLah!

Dieting can be challenging in Singapore, especially on a diet that restricts intake of certain foods. This is especially so for low carb diets such as Keto and Atkins, as Carbohydrates play a central role in many local cuisine. While there are a number of blogs and articles on where dieters could find diet friendly foods, there does not exist a central repository where people can share their findings with others. DietLah! aims to fill this niche with a community driven portal for crowd sourcing information on dining locations, recipes, and in general tips and tricks for dieting in Singapore.
